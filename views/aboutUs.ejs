              <strong>A remarkable about page </strong> is genuine, approachable, and distinguished. Visitors should get a glimpse into what working with you might be like. You can include personal interests, stories, and photos that convey the unique story of your business. You may also include information about who’s on your team and what their roles are.

              About pages are personal to you and your company, so the structure of your about page will vary based on what you want to highlight. However, you’ll start with the same writing process.
              
              Let’s explore the set-by-step guide to building your about page.

              <strong>This is the second item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
